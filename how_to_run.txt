1) Um hello
2) First of all we need to go into our project directory
3) Then we will write "make" to run our "makefile" to make our .o files.
4) Then we will write "./main" to run our script.
5) Optional: 
    To change test cases, change "test1.txt" to "test2.txt" or "test3.txt" in main.cpp on line 26.
6) Yayyy bye bye!
